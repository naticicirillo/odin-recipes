Hey thereðŸ‘‹, welcome to my HTML Recipe Project! I'm pretty excited to dive into this and put my newfound HTML skills to good use by creating a basic recipe website.

So, here's the deal: the website's centerpiece will be the main index page which will have links to a few mouthwatering recipesðŸ˜‹. But I've got to admit, it won't be the most visually appealing site at this stage â€“ unless, of course, you're a fan of that raw and unpolished vibe known as brutalist web design.

But here's the thing, this project is all about honing my HTML skills, and I'm totally on board for that. I'm going to circle back to it down the road to sprinkle some CSS magicðŸª„ and make it look fantastic. So, I'm rolling up my sleeves, and let's embark on this journey to level up my HTML game!
