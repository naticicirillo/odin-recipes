    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 beef cutlets (thinly sliced, about 1/4 inch thick)</li>
        <li>2 cups breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with all-purpose flour, one with beaten eggs (seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper) and one with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Season the beef cutlets with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dredge each cutlet in the flour, ensuring both sides are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Dip the floured cutlet into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off.</li>
        <li>Coat the cutlet with breadcrumbs, pressing them onto both sides to adhere.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, add enough cooking oil to submerge the cutlets halfway. Heat it over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the breaded cutlets in the hot oil, ensuring they don't overlap or crowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry each side for about 3-4 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked Milanesas to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the Milanesas hot, garnished with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
