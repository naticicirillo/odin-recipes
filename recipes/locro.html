    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups hominy corn (canned or dried and soaked overnight)</li>
        <li>1 lb (450g) pork shoulder, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 lb (225g) chorizo sausage, sliced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Sliced green onions (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you're using dried hominy corn, soak it in water overnight, then drain and rinse it thoroughly.</li>
        <li>If you have canned hominy corn, simply rinse and drain it. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a bit of cooking oil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced pork shoulder and sliced chorizo sausage to the pot.</li>
        <li>Cook until the pork is browned and the chorizo is slightly crispy. Remove them from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic.</li>
        <li>Sauté them until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant, usually for about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>To the sautéed aromatics, add the paprika, ground cumin, dried oregano, cayenne pepper (adjust to your preferred level of spiciness), and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir in the hominy corn to combine it with the spices and aromatics.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth into the pot, then add back the browned pork and chorizo.</li>
        <li>Mix everything thoroughly and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld, and the hominy corn should become tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream and let it simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes. This will thicken the stew slightly and add a creamy richness.</li>
        <li>Ladle the hot Locro into bowls.</li>
        <li>Garnish each bowl with chopped fresh cilantro and sliced green onions.</li>
    </ol>
