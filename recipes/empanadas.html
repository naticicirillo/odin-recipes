    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, diced</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green olives, pitted and chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (for sautéing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the cold, diced butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, beat the egg and cold water together.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the egg and water mixture to the flour mixture, mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes while you prepare the filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a skillet, heat a bit of cooking oil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped hard-boiled eggs, chopped olives, raisins, ground cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for a few minutes until everything is well combined. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembling the Empanadas:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface until it's about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Use a round cutter or a small plate to cut out circles from the dough (about 5-6 inches in diameter).</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the meat mixture in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape and crimp the edges with a fork to seal.</li>
        <li>Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the empanadas with a beaten egg for a golden finish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
